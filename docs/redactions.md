# Redactions & Confidentiality

- **No proprietary data** in this repo. Use summaries, not raw logs.
- **Redact**: names, emails, IDs, internal URLs, API keys, internal screenshots.
- **If a screenshot is necessary**: blur sensitive areas and mark as “redacted”.
- **Store originals privately** (not in this repo). Link notes instead.
- **Reference style**: “See redacted evidence in `/evidence/<system>/` and private archive.”
