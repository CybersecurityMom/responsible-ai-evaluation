# Evaluation Plan – <System Name>

**Goal:** Verify fairness, transparency, privacy, and security in a way users understand.

## Scenarios
1) Persona A sees only relevant results; no leakage to unrelated roles/topics
2) Location set to <City, State>; results respect radius/remote toggles
3) Duplicates removed; pagination stable
4) Disclosure displays before evaluation; explanations visible after

## Measures
- Relevance @5 (top-5 usefulness)
- Dedupe rate (%) or spam reduction
- Disclosure clarity (5-point rating)
- Evidence links: `/evidence/<system>/...`
